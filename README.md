# Battleship

## What is Battleship?
Battleship is a two player turn-based game where you have to find and destroy the enemy ships before they find and destroy yours! However this isn't your average Battleship game, there is a twist, ships have special abilities! Attack in a coordinates in cross pattern or in a whole straight line, demolish your enemies! 

## Basic gameplay instructions
1. The goal of the game is to find all enemy ships and destroy them by correctly guessing and attacking the coordinates that their ships are located in.
2. The game starts by having the two players place their corresponding ships in whatever positions they like, the other player won't be allowed to see where their enemy has placed their ships.
3. After placing the ships, both players will be shown two maps, one where they are supposed to attack the enemy player and the other one where they can check on their ship's health, position, and special ability.
4. Now player1 is to choose a method of attack, whether it's a basic attack or special ability to attack, and then select the desired coordinate to attack. After a coordinate is shown, the coordinate selected will change color to indicate if a ship has been hit or not. Red indicates enemy ship hit and white indicates that it was a miss. The turn finishes and now it is player2's turn to do the same.
5. If a ship loses all lives and is destroyed, this ship is out of game, whether it used it special ability or not.
6. The game ends when all of a player's ships have been completely destroyed.
